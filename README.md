**VAPT SSL Pinning App**

The VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing) SSL Pinning App is a security project designed to enhance network communication security in mobile applications. This project focuses on implementing and testing SSL pinning, a technique used to mitigate man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by associating a host with their expected X509 certificate or public key.

**Features**

**Static SSL Pinning**: Verifies the certificate hardcoded in the application, ensuring the app communicates with the precisely intended server only.
**Dynamic SSL Pinning**: Performs the pinning at runtime, allowing more flexibility and updates to the pinning configuration without the need to update the app.
**Testing Utility**: Allows security professionals to test the effectiveness of SSL pinning implementations against various attack scenarios.
**Reporting**: Generates reports based on the testing results, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
